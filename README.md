# Code Refactoring: Booking System

## Thoughts on the Original Code

The original `BookingController.php` and `BookingRepository.php` were functioning correctly, but several areas could be improved to enhance maintainability and scalability.

### Areas for Improvement

- **Single Responsibility Principle**:  
  The `BookingRepository` handled multiple responsibilities, such as business logic and interactions with different tables, which violates the Single Responsibility Principle.

- **Reusability**:  
  The methods were tightly coupled, making it difficult to reuse the code across different parts of the application.

## Refactoring Approach

### Separation of Concerns

- **Modular Repositories**:  
  I broke down the original `BookingRepository` into multiple repositories for each table, isolating data access logic.

- **Enhanced Reusability**:  
  These modular repositories make the code more reusable and easier to maintain.

### Service Layer Introduction

- **Business Logic Handling**:  
  I moved business logic from controllers and repositories into dedicated service classes to ensure the separation of concerns.

- **Thin Controllers**:  
  Controllers were refactored to only handle HTTP requests and responses, making them simpler and more maintainable.

### Code Reusability

- **Reusable Methods**:  
  Created reusable, generic methods that can be shared across different services and repositories, adhering to the DRY principle.

- **DRY Principle**:  
  By eliminating duplicate code, the application is now more efficient and streamlined.

- **Introduced Utilities**:  
  Iâ€™ve also added some general utilities to make things smoother and more consistent, helping with common tasks and keeping the codebase cleaner and easier to manage.


### What can be improved

Some functions are still in the `BookingRepository`. These should be moved to their respective services and repositories to complete the refactoring process.
Additionally, `try-catch` blocks should be to handle exceptions gracefully and prevent the code from breaking.

## Conclusion

The refactored code is now more modular, maintainable, and adheres to SOLID principles. This refactor allows for:
- Easier future development and scalability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Increased code reusability and maintainability

The use of modular repositories and a dedicated service layer not only reduces complexity but also ensures the code is more robust and easier to test.
